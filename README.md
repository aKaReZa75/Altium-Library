   - Note that with this method, you will not automatically receive updates for the repository and will need to manually download any new updates.

### Clone using the URL.
First, open **Git Bash** :
-  Open the folder in **File Explorer** where you want the library to be stored.
-  **Right-click** inside the folder and select the option **"Open Git Bash here"** to open **Git Bash** in that directory.

![open Git Bash](Images/Step0.png)

> [!NOTE] 
> If you do not see the "Open Git Bash here" option, it means that Git is not installed on your system.  
> You can download and install Git from [this link](https://git-scm.com/downloads).  
> For a tutorial on how to install and use Git, check out [this video](https://youtu.be/BsykgHpmUt8).
  
-  Once **Git Bash** is open, run the following command to clone the repository:

 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/aKaReZa75/Altium-Library
```
- You can copy the above command by either:
- Clicking on the **Copy** button on the right of the command.
- Or select the command text manually and press **Ctrl + C** to copy.
- To paste the command into your **Git Bash** terminal, use **Shift + Insert**.

![Clone the Repository](Images/Step1.png)

5. Access the repository:
   - Once extracted, you can access the repository files in the destination folder.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - No Updates: Keep in mind that downloading the repository as a ZIP file does not allow you to receive updates.    
>   If the repository is updated, you will need to download it again manually.  
> - Ease of Use: This method is simpler and suitable for users who are not comfortable with Git or command-line tools.

## 2. Open the Library File
Open the **`aKaReZa.LibPkg`** file in **Altium Designer**.

![Open the Library File](Images/Step2.png)

## 3. Compile the Library
To compile the library:
1. Open the **Projects** from the **Panels** menu.
2. In the Projects panel, locate the file **`aKaReZa.LibPkg`**.
3. Right-click on the file and select **Compile Integrated Library aKaReZa.LibPkg**.
4. Wait for the compilation process to finish.

![Compile the Library](Images/Step3.png)

## 4. Verify Compilation
After successful compilation:
- The integrated library file will be saved in the **`Project Outputs for aKaReZa`** folder.

![Project Outputs for aKaReZa](Images/Step4.png)

- Now, right-click on the aKaReZa.LibPkg file in the Projects panel and select Close Project.

![Close the aKaReZa Project](Images/Step12.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This step closes the library project, ensuring that the integrated library file is ready for use and any subsequent modifications are avoided.  
> This is a crucial step before using the library in your designs.  
> Additionally, this step ensures that no extra files are displayed in the Components panel and only the compiled library file is visible.

- If this step is not done, you might see additional files in the Components panel, which can be confusing and undesirable:

![Extera Files](Images/Step13.png)

- By completing this step, you will only see the compiled aKaReZa library in the **Components** panel.

> [!TIP]
> The compiled library **aKaReZa.LibPkg** remains accessible in the Components panel even after closing the **aKaReZa.LibPkg** project.
  
![Components](Images/Step5.png)

> [!NOTE]
> You may see additional libraries in the Components panel, depending on how many libraries you have previously installed.  
> However, if you follow the steps above, my library will only appear as a single file named **aKaReZa.IntLib** in this panel.

# 🔍 Searching Components in the Library
In this library, components are named using specific conventions to make searching and identifying them more efficient. 
By following these structured naming conventions, you can quickly locate and understand each component within the library.

The naming conventions are as follows:
1. **Component Type**: For example, `Cap` for capacitors.
2. **Subcategory**: e.g., `Elec` for electrolytic capacitors.
3. **Packaging Type**: e.g., `SMD` for surface-mount devices and `THT` for through-hole technology.
4. **Value and Size**: For components with specific values, the value and size will also be included in the name.

> [!TIP]
> To search for the component name, use the Component section in the Panel in Altium.

```

> [!NOTE]
> For better search results in Altium, it is recommended to use `*` instead of `_`. For example, searching for `Res*0805` will bring up all 0805 resistors, whereas searching for `Res_0805` may not return any results.  
> When using underscores (`_`), you need to enter the exact name of the component as it appears in the library.  
> However, with an asterisk (`*`), you can search for partial matches, and Altium will find and display all similar components based on the entered terms.
